I think that it’s necessary for students to prepare for each lesson and express what they don’t understand.

If there is something I don't understand when I study programming, I usually ask tutors, acquaintances and friends immediately.

I always let the tutors know why, where, when, how and what I don’t understand in advance because the time is limited.

I could hear a lot of Japanese in the video.In order to improve my listening skill, I currently use “Easy Japanese” which is a series of videos made by Japanese broadcasting cooperation.

I have watched 2 videos so far. While watching the videos, I reviewed the documents I wrote. I have already had some of the tutors check my errors.
