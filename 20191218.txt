I think that the it’s necessarily for students to prepare and express what we don’t understand.

Usually I study programming.If I don’t understand the programming I study, asap I ask tutors, acquaintance and friends what I don’t understand.

I always tell them in advance why, where, when, how and what I don’t understand because the time is limited.
