I read the Maezawa-san’s tweet and “Japanese billionaire’s search for a mo”.“Awareness” may be one way to resolve the “Gender inequality” for female. I agree to your opinion.

I think there is the reason why Japanese women don’t critisize his proposal is because of “the problem of poverty”. I will give two examples, “the problem of poverty”

### A. Gender Pay Gap

According to the table by NTA(National Tax Agency)' the salary for women is two million eighty hundred seventy thousand yen in 2017.That’s only 53% of the average salary for men.I guess it’s hard to live for two million eighty hundred seventy thousand yen in Japan(Especially big cities).When you click here, you can see the NTA materials.

In addition, According to OECD, Japan ranks sixth from the bottom regarding to the Gender Pay Gap.

### B. Local economy exhaustion

I infer there are few industries in Japanese local cities where women make living by themselves.

In the first place,the banks which pay high salaries in Japanese local cities seem to have no prospects in the future. When you click here, you can read the that a young bank clerk greives.

Even banks are like this.I can't think(I don't think) women getting paid for their living in the other industries.When you click here,you can see the miserable situation.However the article includes the unpleasant expression. If you read it, please read carefully. As long as women’s poverty exists,Billionare’invite is attractive for them.

If Japan was rich like Germany,that would be not attractive. It seems the women accout for 80% at a German medical university.If you are interested in it, click here.

“We know the politeness of clothes and foods.”(“衣食足りて礼節を知る”) but many Japanese are short of even them. Is the issue of gender inequality for you a matter of female awareness? Or is it the issue of women’s poverty?What do you think about that? Let me tell your opinion.
