## 2. Can the goverment achieve work style forms?(政府の働き方改革の実現性)

The question itself is off target because the role of goverment in the economic policy is limited. That is described by the microeconomic textbooks.When the goverment intervene in individual private contracts, Japan will be like Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.

When you click here, you can see the everyday life in the 90s on the video.Pay Special attention from 3:54 in the video. Mostly it’s short of basic groceries.

In addtion, a part of goverment recognizes that it can not respond to economic issues. It has been published as an official report.When you click here,you can read the report by METI,“Fuan-na-Kokka,Tachisukumu-Kojin”.Espesially,in P37,they issues that it’s hard for the goverment to indicate the common goal.

If you have any time, I want you to read the METI’s report.Also let me tell your impression and review.

## 3. Gender inequality（職場における性差別）

The gender inequality for me is the promotion female employee is slow.The symbol is the slang reffering to female employees.That’s “Hey, girls(onnna no ko)”.“onna no ko” meaning,

- “Make her do chorse!”
- “Don’t make her do any important tasks!”

According to the words, most of executives didn’t leave important tasks to female emplyees.This story was 20 years old ago in the department store where I worked at.How do you think about the gender inequality?
